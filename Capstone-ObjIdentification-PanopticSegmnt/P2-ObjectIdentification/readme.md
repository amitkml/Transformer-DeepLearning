# Input Data Preparation

## Input dataset - Concrete defect dataset

A dataset with mask labeling of three major types of concrete surface defects: crack, spalling and exposed rebar, was prepared for training and testing of the model. In this dataset, three open-domain datasets [1-3] are exploited and merged with a bridge inspection image dataset [4] from the Highways Department. To use the dataset, you need comply with the terms and conditions of using the images from the Highways Department, therefore please write a statement and e-mail it to:czhangbd@connect.ust.hk.

For the COCO data format, first of all, there is only a single JSON file for all the annotation in a dataset or one for each split of datasets(Train/Val/Test).
